Ghost Tattoo:<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>They can be simple and minimalistic, or more traditional and detailed, but either way, ghost tattoos have cemented themselves as a significant symbol for Halloween. In this context, these tattoos typically represent the dead returning to the world of the living for \\u2018All Hallows Eve\\u2019 \\u2013 a scary concept no matter which way you look at it. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/boomradio.com.au\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/10\\/image.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-28832\\\" width=\\\"123\\\" height=\\\"163\\\"\\/><figcaption>Source: All Things Tattoo<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>4. Jack-O-Lantern Tattoo<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It doesn\\u2019t get more Halloween-y than this. The use of Jack-O-Lanterns dates back to the 1600\\u2019s, and actually derives its name from an old Irish folktale about a man named Stingy Jack. These days, Jack-O-Lanterns are used to emulate the spirit of Halloween, and these tattoos normally have a haunted look so any bad dispositions stay away from you. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/boomradio.com.au\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/10\\/image-1.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-28833\\\" width=\\\"252\\\" height=\\\"131\\\" srcset=\\\"https:\\/\\/boomradio.com.au\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/10\\/image-1.png 917w, https:\\/\\/boomradio.com.au\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/10\\/image-1-800x419.png 800w, https:\\/\\/boomradio.com.au\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/10\\/image-1-768x402.png 768w\\\" sizes=\\\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\\\" \\/><figcaption>Source: Inked Mag<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>3. Skull Tattoo<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When it comes to frightening tattoos with even scarier imagery, the skull tat is definitely up there. It generally represents death, and usually symbolises that the person with the tattoo does not fear it. It can also serve as a reminder that death is inevitable, and you should make the most of life while you can \\u2013 sometimes the most frightening thing of all is the fear of our own mortality. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/boomradio.com.au\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/10\\/image-2.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-28834\\\" width=\\\"134\\\" height=\\\"166\\\"\\/><figcaption>Source: Dubuddha<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>2. Evil Clown Tattoo<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Everybody\\u2019s different, but I think the general consensus is clowns are friggin\\u2019 freaky, man. But, Pennywise aside, the scary part about evil clown tattoos isn\\u2019t just the design, it\\u2019s the meaning behind them. While the clowns may be smiling on the surface to show laughter and happiness, just below the surface they represent despair, malice, misery and depression. Sometimes, the scariest monsters aren\\u2019t the ones in movies or under your bed \\u2013 the scariest monsters are the ones inside your head. <\\/p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\\\"wp-block-image\\\"><figure class=\\\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\\\"><img loading=\\\"lazy\\\" src=\\\"https:\\/\\/boomradio.com.au\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2021\\/10\\/image-3.png\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"wp-image-28835\\\" width=\\\"110\\\" height=\\\"184\\\"\\/><figcaption>Source: Pinterest<\\/figcaption><\\/figure><\\/div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>1.
